TEST SUITE FOR LAB 4

I tried really hard to match outputs and I passed the four exercises so I am pretty sure my outputs are correctly formatted, but they may not be! I am sorry in advance if they aren't, I did my best! Good Luck!


I have 5 different tests:
Test 1: the inputs from the lab handout + some other inputs which I thought could cause problems
Test 2-5: the tests that the submit script uses, line for line (thought it would be easy to have 		  them all in one place!)

Compile your program with the -g flag so that valgrind will tell you what line the memory error is on, it will help a lot!

Extract your files into the same directory you expect your executable to be!



TO COMPILE 
(from your directory with your project files):

	g++ -c -g Main.cpp
	g++ -c -g Resistor.cpp
	g++ -c -g Node.cpp
	g++ -c -g ResistorList.cpp
	g++ -c -g NodeList.cpp
	g++ -c -g Rparser.cpp

(Alternativly: g++ -c -g *.cpp //just make sure you don't have extra .cpp files in your directory)

	g++ -o rnet.exe Main.o Resistor.o Node.o ResistorList.o NodeList.o Rparser.o

(Alternativly: g++ -o rnet.exe *.o //make sure you didn't have any extra .cpp files that would 					    make more .o files in yoru directory!)



TO RUN TEST
(from the directory with your executable [should be same directory as compilation])
rnet.exe = the name of your executable, I chose rnet.exe again!


TEST1
	valgrind --leak-check=full ./rnet < testInput1.txt > myOutput1.txt
	diff myOutput1.txt tannerOutput1.txt

TEST2
	valgrind --leak-check=full ./rnet < testInput2.txt > myOutput2.txt
	diff myOutput1.txt tannerOutput2.txt

TEST3
	valgrind --leak-check=full ./rnet < testInput3.txt > myOutput3.txt
	diff myOutput1.txt tannerOutput3.txt

TEST4
	valgrind --leak-check=full ./rnet < testInput4.txt > myOutput4.txt
	diff myOutput1.txt tannerOutput4.txt

TEST5
	valgrind --leak-check=full ./rnet < testInput5.txt > myOutput5.txt
	diff myOutput1.txt tannerOutput5.txt
