Graph Implementation
Tanner Young-Schultz

For the purpose of studying for our exam and preperation for next semester

Note the implementation of the Graph. It is fully dynamicâ€¦ the vertices are in linked list form and each vertex has a linked list of Edge objects that point to a vertex in the linked list of vertices.

I tried to be consistent with the structure of our labs, so I made Edge, Vertex and Graph objects and made as many members private as I could!

Couple Recourses:

	Visualizing the graph data structure (Adjacency list/matrix):

	youtube video explaining algorithm (best I could find, and what I used):

	C++ guide (with pseudo code) describing algorithm:

Compile from a directory with just these files in it:
	
	g++ -g *.cpp -o Graph

If you want to play around with inputs:
	
	./Graph

If you want to see my example inputs:
	
	./Graph < input1.txt
		or
	./Graph < input2.txt




Have not run valgrind on it, I am pretty sure I delete all dynamic memory but I am not 100% sure... don't yell at me if there is leakage.

Let me know of any BUGS please :)!
