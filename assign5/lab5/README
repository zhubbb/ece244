Tanner Young-Schultz Test Suite Lab 5

Version 1 of tester for lab 5 (passed exercise script)
	Please let me know about errors if found!

Compling (assuming only neccessary .cpp, .h and .o files are in working directory):

	g++ -c -g *.cpp		//-g flag is for line numbers in valgrind

	g++ *.o -o IP		//I named my IP, doesn't matter

Execution (replace the # sign in the command with the appropriate test file number (1-5)):

	valgrind --leak-check=full ./IP < input#.txt > yourOutput#.txt

Comparison (replace the # sign in the command with the appropriate test file number (1-5)):

	*Note if you are having trouble with spacing (which should not be a huge issue in this 		lab) use the -b (ignores white space length) or -w flag (ignore all white space). 
	man diff, for more info on flags.


	diff yourOutput#.txt outputReference#.txt

Enjoy :-) !
